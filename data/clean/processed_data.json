      "Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B, BRK-A) CEO Warren Buffett defended his company's growing cash pile, reflected on mistakes, and again touted what he called the American miracle of US economic growth over the last two centuries as the conglomerate reported record operating earnings of $47.4 billion last year. Writing in his 2024 annual letter to Berkshire shareholders published Saturday, Buffett said these record profits came despite more than half (53%) of the company's operating businesses reporting a decline in earnings last year. In 2024, Berkshire did better than I expected though 53% of our 189 operating businesses reported a decline in earnings, Buffett wrote. We were aided by a predictable large gain in investment income as Treasury Bill yields improved and we substantially increased our holdings of these highly-liquid short-term securities. At the end of the year, Berkshire's pile of cash and other cash-like securities, such as Treasury Bills, stood at $334.2 billion, almost double the $167.6 billion seen at the end of 2023. The value of Berkshire's equity portfolio stood at $272 billion at year-end; at the end of 2023, these holdings were valued at $354 billion. Major sales of Berkshire's stake in Apple (AAPL) during the first, second, and third",
      "holdings were valued at $354 billion. Major sales of Berkshire's stake in Apple (AAPL) during the first, second, and third quarters of 2024 saw the value of its holdings in the tech giant fall by about $100 billion. Despite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at Berkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities, Buffett wrote Saturday. That preference won’t change. While our ownership in marketable equities moved downward last year from $354 billion to $272 billion, the value of our non-quoted controlled equities increased somewhat and remains far greater than the value of the marketable portfolio. Berkshire shareholders can rest assured that we will forever deploy a substantial majority of their money in equities — mostly American equities although many of these will have international operations of significance. For the full-year 2024, Berkshire's total revenues reached $371.4 billion, up from $364.5 billion the prior year. Its investment gains tallied $41.6 billion, down from $58.9 billion in 2023 and reflecting how these numbers can, to use Buffett's words, swing wildly and unpredictably from year to year. The company's $47.4 billion operating profit excludes its investment portfolio's gains or losses. Berkshire's reported net earnings inclusive",
      "to year. The company's $47.4 billion operating profit excludes its investment portfolio's gains or losses. Berkshire's reported net earnings inclusive of its investment gains tallied $89 billion last year, down from $96.2 billion in 2023. 'I've made mistakes' At the top of this year's annual letter, Buffett began with reflections on the many mistakes made at Berkshire Hathaway over the years, but kept his comments general on the advice of the late Tom Murphy: praise by name, criticize by category. Sometimes I’ve made mistakes in assessing the future economics of a business I’ve purchased for Berkshire – each a case of capital allocation gone wrong. That happens with both judgments about marketable equities — we view these as partial ownership of businesses — and the 100% acquisitions of companies. At other times, I’ve made mistakes when assessing the abilities or fidelity of the managers Berkshire is hiring. The fidelity disappointments can hurt beyond their financial impact, a pain that can approach that of a failed marriage. During the 2019-23 period, I have used the words 'mistake' or 'error' 16 times in my letters to you, Buffett added. Many other huge companies have never used either word over that span. Buffett",
      "in my letters to you, Buffett added. Many other huge companies have never used either word over that span. Buffett added that, given his advanced age, it won't be long before Greg Abel takes his place as CEO and writes annual letters to Berkshire shareholders. Greg shares the Berkshire creed that a 'report' is what a Berkshire CEO annually owes to owners, Buffett wrote. And he also understands that if you start fooling your shareholders, you will soon believe your own baloney and be fooling yourself as well. In reference to Berkshire's current investments, Buffett also noted some of the disappointments that populate that portfolio. We own nothing that is a major drag, Buffett wrote, but we have a number that I should not have purchased. Buffett, as he has done in recent years, also boasted of Berkshire's tax outlays and touted the US economic tailwind that has benefited him and his businesses as an investor and operator. In this year's letter, Buffett noted the $26.8 billion in taxes paid by Berkshire this year is the most any individual company has ever paid to the US government. To be precise, Berkshire last year made four payments to the IRS that",
      "has ever paid to the US government. To be precise, Berkshire last year made four payments to the IRS that totaled $26.8 billion. That’s about 5% of what all of corporate America paid, Buffett wrote. In a very minor way, Berkshire shareholders have participated in the American miracle by foregoing dividends, thereby electing to reinvest rather than consume, Buffett wrote. Originally, this reinvestment was tiny, almost meaningless, but over time, it mushroomed, reflecting the mixture of a sustained culture of savings, combined with the magic of long-term compounding. Berkshire’s activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished... Someday your nieces and nephews at Berkshire hope to send you even larger payments than we did in 2024. Spend it wisely. In addition to commentary on Berkshire's businesses and other investment topics, Buffett's letter has become more closely watched for the changes in the company's sprawling annual meeting, typically held on the first weekend in May. This year's edition, set for May 3, will feature a somewhat changed schedule, Buffett wrote on Saturday, with the famed Q&A session starting and ending earlier.

Buffett will be joined once again by Berkshire vice chairmen Greg Abel — Buffett's heir apparent — and Ajit Jain for two-and-a-half hours starting at 8:00 a.m. After a short break, only Abel will join Buffett on stage, with the Q&A session wrapping up by 1:00 p.m. In years past, Buffett's Q&A with shareholders has stretched towards 3:00 p.m. local time; in 2020, the Q&A ran well into the night."

      "If robotaxi fleets run by car companies are the future — as laid out by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk — you can count luxury legend Mercedes-Benz out of the mix. Our job is to take you from A to B in style. We're not a public transportation service or a mobility service provider. We could give you products if you want it, and we can sell you, but we want to give you individually that technology, Mercedes-Benz (MBG.DE) CEO Ola Källenius told me this week on an earnings call with reporters. The German auto giant is focused on improving its driverless technology that is then sold with its cars, instead of operating a service. Added Källenius, I drove some of the latest [driverless tech] stuff that we had in China just on my last trip, and I was absolutely blown away by how good it worked and how the car even drove itself through a complete parking garage several floors and just found a spot for me.

Listen: How Ford's CEO interacts with Elon Musk Waymo currently operates a robotaxi fleet in 37 square miles of Austin. Tesla intends to use its internal Model 3 and Model Y fleet for the initial launch, as the Cybercab isn't slated to enter production until sometime in 2026. The Cybercab was unveiled last October at a glitzy event at a Warner Bros. studio in Burbank, Calif. It's a battery-powered autonomous car without a steering wheel or pedals. It's currently being beta tested in the Bay Area, where Tesla employees hail rides using an app, though the vehicles still feature safety drivers. Musk envisions producing 2 million to 4 million Cybercabs a year. Some on the Street view a robotaxi fleet in coming years as a key part of the bullish investment thesis on Tesla's stock.

You could create this great economic growth. Similar to Mercedes-Benz, General Motors is leaning into its Super Cruise driverless assistance platform. After a series of operational setbacks, GM pulled the plug on its Cruise robotaxi business late in 2024. The company had invested $10 billion since acquiring Cruise in 2016.

      "Gold was on track for its eighth weekly gain Friday as buyers sought out the safe-haven asset amid the threat of tariffs and a price disparity between the US and London created incentives to ship more physical kilo bars into New York. On Friday, gold futures (GC=F) backed off their all-time high from the prior session to hover near $2,950 while the spot, or wholesale reserve price in London, traded at around $2,930 an ounce. Gold is up roughly 11% year to date after hitting its 11th record of 2025 on Thursday. Much of that price action is attributed to continued central bank buying, geopolitical risks, and uncertainty over US tariffs, including the possibility that even the precious metal wouldn't be spared from broad-based levies. Earlier this week, President Trump said he intends to impose levies on autos, semiconductors, and pharmaceutical products. Plans for retaliatory tariffs against countries that charge levies on US goods are also expected in April. Read more: What are tariffs, and how do they affect you? Uncertainty over attempts at a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia also put upward pressure on the precious metal. Meanwhile, a larger-than-normal price difference between gold futures in the US",
      "Russia also put upward pressure on the precious metal. Meanwhile, a larger-than-normal price difference between gold futures in the US and the wholesale reserve, or spot price in London, has prompted institutional investors to ship elevated amounts of physical gold bars to vaults in New York. Gold inventories for the futures exchange COMEX have spiked since November, reaching their highest level since the pandemic in 2021, according to Bloomberg data. I think there’s some fear that if the gold isn’t available for one reason or another, the price is going to explode, Brett Elliott, director of marketing at American Precious Metals Exchange (APMEX), told Yahoo Finance. What they [institutional investors] started doing in response is stockpiling. ... When you have conditions like that and you throw in some safe haven demands on top of it, you’re going to see the price of gold start to creep up, he said. Central bank demand for gold hit an all-time high last year, with purchases accelerating in the fourth quarter, according to the World Gold Council. At the heart of everything, that risk and allocation to gold as a diversifier remains prominent for investors, said Joe Cavatoni, market strategist at the World Gold",
      "and allocation to gold as a diversifier remains prominent for investors, said Joe Cavatoni, market strategist at the World Gold Council. It’s absolutely an essential asset. The Federal Reserve's rate-cutting cycle last year drove prices higher as the non-yielding asset became more attractive to investors. Despite the Fed's pause on rate cuts and market uncertainty over its next rate decision, Wall Street predicts more gains for the precious metal this year. Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs analysts raised their year-end 2025 gold price forecast to $3,100 per troy ounce, up from $2,890 and on structurally higher central bank demand, led by the largest buyer, China. We estimate that structurally higher central bank demand will add 9% to the gold price by year-end, wrote Goldman's commodity strategist Lina Thomas. However, if policy uncertainty — including tariff fears — stays high, higher speculative positioning for longer could push gold prices as high as $3,300/toz by year-end, the strategist said. Meanwhile, global fund managers surveyed by BofA believe gold will beat out US equities to rank as the second-best-performing asset class in 2025, right behind global equities.

      "Rivian (RIVN) reported strong fourth quarter results after the bell on Thursday and came through on its goal of posting a gross profit for the quarter. The company posted a smaller-than-expected full-year 2024 EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) loss to boot and sees a smaller loss in 2025 compared to a year ago. Despite the positive results, Rivian stock dipped 3% in early trading on Friday. Rivian reported a gross profit of $170 million in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by improvements in variable costs, revenue per delivered unit, and fixed costs, the company said in a statement. This quarter we achieved positive gross profit and removed $31,000 in automotive cost of goods sold per vehicle delivered in Q4 2024 relative to Q4 2023, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. Our focus on cost efficiency across the business is critical for the launch of our mass market product, R2. The R2 bill of materials is approximately 95% sourced and is expected to be approximately half that of the improved R1 bill of materials.

      "of guidance, Rivian sees its 2025 full-year adjusted EBITDA loss in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, with vehicle deliveries between 46,000 and 51,000. On the conference call, CFO Claire McDonough said the company expects fewer deliveries in Q1 due to seasonality and the effects of the wildfires on the state of California, where many Rivian purchases are made. McDonough said the company expects only 8,000 deliveries in Q1 and 14,000 units to be produced. Rivian stock was up over 3% in after-hours trading but lost those gains. RIVN provided relatively conservative FY25 guidance as the company battles a myriad of macro headwinds while looking to balance the ramp of its vehicle lines to generate stable revenue growth while remaining prudent on spend to drive bottom-line expansion, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients. FY25 delivery guidance of 46k to 51k vehicles implies negative y/y growth in deliveries including an 8k delivery target for 1Q as the company's planned plant shutdown in the 2H25 for R2 integration is impacting delivery guidance.

The company reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.46, beating estimates for a $0.65 loss, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $277 million, better than the $399.8 million expected. For the year 2024, Rivian posted an adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.68 billion, lower than the $2.87 billion loss projected last quarter and an improvement compared to the $3.78 billion loss from a year ago. In early January, the company said it produced 49,476 vehicles and delivered 51,579 in 2024. In Q4, Rivian produced 12,727 vehicles and delivered 14,183 vehicles. Rivian said it had $5.29 billion in cash and cash equivalents, down from $7.85 billion a year ago. The fourth quarter was an interesting one for Rivian. In November, the company announced an expansion of its partnership with Volkswagen (VWAGY), with the German automaker pouring more money into a joint venture.

In November, Rivian also revealed that it won a conditional commitment from the Department of Energy (DOE) for a $6.6 billion loan, highlighting Rivian's improving capital condition. The loan, part of the DOE's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program, would support the construction of Rivian's upcoming assembly plant located outside Atlanta. The new Trump White House, however, and the Department of Government Efficiency say they will scrutinize the deal, potentially putting the DOE loan to Rivian in limbo. We reiterate our Sell rating in light of RIVN's 35% jump since its Q3 earnings release, the weaker-than-expected 2025 guidance, and risks related to a potential clawback of the $6.6B Energy Department loan approved late in the Biden administration, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson wrote in a note to clients.

      "Reddit (RDDT) stock has lost roughly 23% since its earnings report last week, coming off a six-month rally that saw shares quadruple. The social media platform, which went public nearly a year ago, last week reported its fiscal fourth quarter earnings. Though earnings per share surpassed estimates, Reddit daily active users fell from the prior quarter due to a change in Google's Search algorithm that hurt traffic to the site. CEO Steve Huffman told analysts in a call last Wednesday that traffic from Google Search has recovered in the first quarter and regained momentum. Shares fell 5% in the next trading day and have continued to plummet over the past week. The stock's 19% five-day loss was the largest decline over that time period since April 2024. Huffman and his trust sold roughly $70.5 million worth of Reddit shares Tuesday, according to SEC filings — by far the largest stock sale by the chief executive to date. For comparison, prior to Feb. 18, Huffman's largest Reddit stock sale was 1,400 shares worth $2.8 million on Jan. 31. Additionally, Reddit shares on Thursday declined 7.5% as the US Federal Trade Commission filed an inquiry into tech platforms for policies that ban",
      "on Thursday declined 7.5% as the US Federal Trade Commission filed an inquiry into tech platforms for policies that ban users for certain content. Reddit's policies can ban users if they bully or harass users or post sexually explicit and abusive content. While Reddit stock's drop has erased most of its gains year to date, the stock is still up nearly 220% from six months ago. Investors have seized on the platform's surging advertising revenue and growing deals with big AI companies such as OpenAI, in which Reddit licenses its data (i.e., user posts) to train their artificial intelligence models. Most Wall Street analysts have maintained their Buy ratings on Reddit stock, with JMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone noting very elevated buyside expectations before the company's recent earnings report."
